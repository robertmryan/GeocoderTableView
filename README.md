#  GeocoderTableView

This is a quick-and-dirty demonstration of updating distances to user's location in a tableview.

* Consists of tableview of a series of objects with geographic addresses.
* Geocodes those addresses in a just-in-time manner.
* As user location changes, update the distance to the address in each row of the table.

Note, this is not a fully functional app, but rather is a throw-away demonstration of the concept.

Note, this demo has three model objects, but then proceeds to create a bunch of test rows (just so you can test the scrolling behavior). Clearly, you wouldn't create test rows like this in a real app, but it's just for illustration purposes.
